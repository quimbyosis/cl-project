# cl-project
My Code Louisville project
For this project, I'm reworking the website for the presidential candidate Limberbutt McCubbins.
!!!******I scrapped this version of my project. I know I could have started a new branch, but it seemed like a better idea to start a new repo. I also figured out how to work from the console a little more easily so the other repo is more thorough. Please see cl2_project repo for my completed, polished project.
